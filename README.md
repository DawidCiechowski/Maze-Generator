## Introduction

A simple maze generator using Recursive backtracker methods. This project has been written as a part of university project.

### How it works

Essentially, the program starts at cell X: 0, Y: 0 and marks the cell as visited. It then checks all the neighbours and whether they were visited before. It randomly chooses of the neighbours and automatically removes the wall between them. The methods is then recursively called for a chosen cell.
